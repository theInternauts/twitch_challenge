Model
* json obj with only the data I want


Controller
* makes async calls to contruct models
* call views, passes them the models, and assigns the views to variables
* assign listener for events handle events
* pagination utils go here to make async calls and update the models
*

View
------need generic VIEW with utilities
----create 3 views with specialized utils
--this.buildSearchBar()
--this.buildResultsPanelContainer()
* iterate over models
* create DOM nodes?
* listen for events and trigger events
* pagination click a button, fire an event, listen for response event,display new data (from the updated model)
* need methods to clear DOM when model is updated.  (listen for event, delete old model, re-load new model)
+++ need to lookup in MDN the generic handle(r) syntax to catch all events and test/handle them via a massive switch
